                Hi!
                I’m Ambika, a student at the Community College of Baltimore County, and mom of a beautiful baby girl.
                I’m excited and eager to learn more about HTML and web development.

                I completed my high school diploma in Nepal.
                In Nepal, I had a completely different academic background (Education Faculty)
                and never had the opportunity to learn about web development.

                I learned some basic concepts of HTML at a computer institute from my seniors. 
                I have also experience with python. In my free time, I enjoy watching TV series and historical movies.
