    <h1> Learning Web Standards</h1>
    <h2>Labs 1, 2 & 3</h2>
    <em>Published on August 6, 2024 by The Professor</em>
    <p>My first webpage! At first, the process seemed daunting, with so many tags and structures to<br>
        remember, but breaking it down step by step made in manageable.
        <br>Learning how to properly structure and HTML helped me understand <br>how webpages are built and displayed.</p>
    <h3>What I learned in Lab02</h3>
    <p class="blue">In Lab02, I learned to use basic tags and attributes, such as break a paragraph, making text bold or italic, creating ordered and unordered list, and adding headings styles. 
        <br> I also learned how to connect links to websites. <br> There are 3 types of HTML relationship. Parent, Child and Sibling.
        <br> ID, Class, Title, Style are the attributes in HTML, that helps to organize element and improve the apperance of the webpages.
       <br>ID:ID is a universal attribute in web standards. <br> Class: Class provide context to the element.<br>Title: Title provides extra information.<br>Style:Apply inline stylesheet.
    </p>
    
    <br>I learned in Module two about HTML basic concept and CSS.
    <ol>
        <li>A thing I learned is h1 to h6 to define heading size</li>
        <li>Another thing I learned is to make text bold or italic.</li>
        <li> So many thingsI learned about tags and attributes.! For example, em, u, br, p, d1, dd, dt, tags. </li>
    </ol>
    Learning about HTML is an exciting part this semestar.<br> 
        I enjoy a lot and feel a little bit confusion. But reading and<br>
        following the instructions carefully helped me to complete my assignment.
